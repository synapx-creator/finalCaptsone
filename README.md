lowest stock and allow the user to restock, display the product with the highesy quantity of stock, calculate the total value of each stock item and display these values
or exit the menu by entering specific commands as displayed in the menu.

in the necessary format. You should now be able to run the .py file as long as the .txt file is in the correct location.

## Usage
Running the file will generate a menu and prompt you to enter a specific input as a way to choose what you would like to do. The menu provides a brief description of
what each choice does.
